# Azure-Data-Engineering-ADF-DBX-RBAC-UC-CI/CD

# Project Objective

Ingesting on-premise (SQL and SFTP) data and transforming it using Azure Data Factory, Databricks followed by analyzing and reporting using PowerBI

In this project the main aim is to understand the Flow of data from Various Data Sources to Azure Cloud Platform while transforming the data to get the final set of tables for further analysis and visualization in Tableau software
This project involves use of Databricks Unity Catelog instead of Databricks MetaStore. The reason for the discontinuation of the Metastore is that it will be replaced by Unity Catalog, which is a unified data governance platform designed to work across all environments. Unity Catalog offers centralized management of data access, security, and compliance, making it a more comprehensive solution for governing data across multiple platforms and cloud environments compared to the Metastore

This project includes migrating the metadata store from MetaStore to Unity Catalog. It also involves creating roles using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and transferring those roles within the Databricks Catalog using the SCIM connector

In real-time scenarios, organizations often grapple with petabytes of structured data dispersed across numerous on-premises locations. Leveraging cloud solutions streamlines data processing, circumventing the limitations and inefficiencies of current infrastructure. This shift not only sidesteps the extensive planning, time, and financial investment required for new infrastructure setup but also mitigates the risk of such investments becoming obsolete. Ultimately, transitioning to the cloud facilitates swift, cost-effective achievement of data processing objectives with minimal complexity
